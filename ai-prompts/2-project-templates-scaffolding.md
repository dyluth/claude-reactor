# Feature: Project Templates & Scaffolding

## 1. Description
Create an intelligent project scaffolding system that generates optimized development environments based on project type, automatically creating appropriate directory structures, configuration files, and development workflows. This eliminates the "blank canvas" problem and provides developers with production-ready project foundations that include claude-reactor integration, testing frameworks, and deployment configurations.

## Goal statement
To provide developers with intelligent, one-command project initialization that creates production-ready development environments with optimal tooling, testing, and deployment configurations tailored to their specific technology stack.

## Project Analysis & current state

### Technology & architecture
- **Current claude-reactor**: Go-based CLI with auto-detection for 5 container variants (base, go, full, cloud, k8s)
- **Project Detection Logic**: Existing auto-detection in `internal/config/manager.go` for Go, Rust, Node.js, Python, Java, K8s projects
- **Template System**: No current scaffolding system - opportunity to build from scratch
- **Configuration Management**: Existing `.claude-reactor` configuration system for project preferences
- **Container Integration**: Established Docker SDK integration for seamless environment setup
- **Build Automation**: Makefile system with 25+ targets for professional development workflows
- **Key Files**: `internal/config/manager.go`, `claude-reactor` CLI, project detection logic, Dockerfile variants

### current state
**Current Developer Workflow:**
1. Developer creates empty project directory
2. Manually initializes language-specific files (go.mod, package.json, etc.)
3. Manually runs `./claude-reactor run` for container setup
4. Manually creates development tooling (Makefile, tests, CI/CD, etc.)
5. Manual integration of best practices and project structure

**Missing Scaffolding Integration:**
- No project template system or intelligent initialization
- No automated best practice integration (testing, linting, formatting)
- No development workflow templates (Makefile, scripts, CI/CD)
- Manual setup creates inconsistent project structures across teams
- No integration between project templates and claude-reactor variants

## context & problem definition

### problem statement
**Who**: Developers and teams starting new projects who want consistent, production-ready development environments
**What**: Currently face setup friction, inconsistent project structures, missing best practices, and manual integration of development tooling
**Why**: Manual project setup leads to inconsistent structures, forgotten best practices, and significant time investment before actual development can begin

**Current Pain Points:**
- **Setup Friction**: 30+ minutes to set up proper project structure and tooling
- **Inconsistent Standards**: Different developers create different project structures
- **Missing Best Practices**: Forgotten linting, formatting, testing setup, and CI/CD integration
- **Tool Integration**: Manual claude-reactor setup and variant selection
- **Team Onboarding**: New team members must learn project structure patterns

## 5. Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- **Template Validation**: Test template metadata parsing and validation
- **Variable Collection**: Test interactive and non-interactive variable gathering
- **CLI Integration**: Test command parsing, template selection, and project generation
- **File Operations**: Test directory creation, file writing, and permission handling

### Integration Tests

- **Multi-Platform**: Test template generation across macOS, Linux, and Windows (WSL2)
- **Git Integration**: Test repository initialization and configuration
- **Development Workflow**: Test generated Makefile targets and tooling integration

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests
- **Complete Developer Workflow**: Template selection â generation â development â testing â deployment
- **Multi-Template Testing**: Generate and validate projects from each available template
- **Team Collaboration**: Test shared template usage and customization across team members
- **CI/CD Integration**: Test non-interactive template generation in automated environments
- **Template Updates**: Test template upgrade and migration workflows

## 6. Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- Template system operates locally with no authentication required
- Custom template directories should respect filesystem permissions
- No network access required for core template functionality

### Data Validation & Sanitization
- **Template Variable Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs to template variables
- **File Path Validation**: Ensure generated file paths cannot escape project directory
- **Template Content Scanning**: Validate template files don't contain malicious content
- **Dependency Validation**: Check generated project dependencies against known vulnerabilities

### Potential Vulnerabilities
- **Path Traversal**: Malicious templates could attempt to write files outside project directory - mitigation: strict path validation
- **Code Injection**: Template variables could inject malicious code - mitigation: input sanitization and safe templating
- **Dependency Confusion**: Generated projects might include malicious dependencies - mitigation: use trusted dependency sources
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Large templates could consume excessive resources - mitigation: resource limits and validation

## 7. Rollout & Deployment

### Feature Flags
No feature flags needed - this is an additive feature that doesn't change existing workflows.

### Deployment Steps
1. **Template Development**: Create and test initial template library
2. **CLI Integration**: Add template commands to claude-reactor CLI
3. **Documentation**: Complete template usage and development guides
4. **Beta Testing**: Test with development teams for feedback and iteration
5. **Public Release**: Announce template system and provide migration guides

### Rollback Plan
- **No Impact Rollback**: Feature is additive - simply don't use template commands
- **Template Removal**: Remove template commands from CLI if needed
- **Full Backwards Compatibility**: All existing claude-reactor workflows remain unchanged
- **Generated Project Independence**: Generated projects work independently of template system

## 8. Open Questions & Assumptions

### Open Questions
1. Should templates be embedded in binary or downloaded from registry/repository?
2. How do we handle template versioning and backwards compatibility?
3. Should we support template composition (multiple templates in one project)?
4. What's the best approach for organizational template distribution and sharing?
5. Should templates include IDE-specific configurations (VS Code, IntelliJ)?
6. How do we handle template updates for existing projects?
7. What level of customization should be built into core templates vs custom templates?

### Assumptions
- Developers prefer opinionated templates with best practices over minimal templates
- Template generation time under 60 seconds is acceptable for the value provided
- Teams will want to customize templates for organizational standards
- Generated projects should be independent of the template system after creation
- Template system should be extensible for community contributions
- Interactive template configuration is preferred over extensive command-line flags
