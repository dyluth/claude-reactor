# Feature: Multi-Architecture Support

## 1. Description
Add automatic multi-architecture support to Claude-Reactor, enabling seamless operation across ARM64 (Apple Silicon, modern ARM servers) and x86_64 (Intel/AMD) platforms. The system will automatically detect the host architecture and build the appropriate Docker images without requiring user configuration, maintaining the project's zero-configuration philosophy while expanding platform compatibility.

## Goal statement
To automatically detect and build architecture-appropriate Docker containers for ARM64 and x86_64 platforms, ensuring Claude-Reactor works seamlessly across all major hardware platforms without user intervention.

## Project Analysis & current state

### Technology & architecture
- **Docker Multi-stage Builds**: Current Dockerfile uses multi-stage builds with 5 variants (base, go, full, cloud, k8s)
- **Shell Scripting**: Main logic in `claude-reactor` script handles container management and configuration
- **Makefile Automation**: 25+ targets in Makefile for build and test automation  
- **Configuration Management**: `.claude-reactor` file stores user preferences per project
- **Host Integration**: Mounts host directories and configuration files into containers
- **Key Files**: `Dockerfile`, `claude-reactor` script, `Makefile`, `tests/integration/test-variants.sh`

### current state
**Current Go CLI Implementation Status:**
- **Phase 0 Complete**: Go CLI has achieved feature parity with bash script 
- **Multi-Architecture Docker Support**: Dockerfile includes dynamic architecture detection and appropriate binary downloads
- **Build System**: Makefile supports cross-platform builds with automatic architecture detection
- **Container Management**: Go-based Docker SDK integration handles architecture-aware container lifecycle
- **Configuration**: Account isolation and variant management fully implemented

**Remaining Multi-Architecture Enhancements:**
- Advanced registry support with architecture-specific image tags
- Cross-platform performance optimization
- Enhanced architecture detection and validation
- Improved multi-platform testing capabilities

## context & problem definition

### problem statement
**Who**: Developers using Claude-Reactor across mixed architecture environments (ARM64 MacBooks, x86_64 Linux servers, Intel Macs)
**What**: Currently face architecture compatibility issues, slow container performance, and potential build failures when containers don't match host architecture
**Why**: No automatic architecture detection means containers may be built for wrong platform, leading to emulation overhead and compatibility issues

### success criteria
- [ ] 100% automatic architecture detection with zero user configuration required
- [ ] Native performance on both ARM64 and x86_64 platforms (no emulation)
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained - existing workflows unchanged
- [ ] Build time improvement of 50%+ on ARM64 systems (eliminating x86_64 emulation)
- [ ] Cross-platform team collaboration without architecture-specific issues

## technical requirements

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with current Go CLI architecture and Docker SDK integration
- Build on existing multi-architecture foundation already implemented in Phase 0
- Integrate seamlessly with current container registry support (ghcr.io)
- Must work with existing Docker installation (no additional buildx requirements)

- Must maintain current container size optimization and performance
- Cross-platform compatibility across macOS, Linux, and Windows (WSL2)

- **Registry integration**: Architecture-specific image tags in container registries

## Implementation plan

## 5. Testing Strategy
### Unit Tests
- Architecture detection function with various `uname -m` outputs
- Container naming logic with architecture suffixes
- Configuration parsing and architecture storage
- Error handling for unsupported architectures

### Integration Tests
- Container builds on both ARM64 and x86_64 platforms
- All 5 variants building successfully with correct architecture
- Container startup and Claude CLI functionality
- Cross-platform configuration file compatibility

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests
- Complete workflow test on ARM64: detect → build → run → cleanup
- Complete workflow test on x86_64: detect → build → run → cleanup
- Project sharing scenario: ARM64 user creates .claude-reactor, x86_64 user uses same project
- Architecture transition: same user moving from ARM64 to x86_64 machine

## 6. Security Considerations
### Authentication & Authorization
No changes to authentication model - existing Claude CLI authentication methods maintained.

### Data Validation & Sanitization
- Validate architecture detection output against known values (arm64, amd64)
- Sanitize architecture strings used in container names to prevent injection
- Ensure architecture detection cannot be manipulated maliciously

### Potential Vulnerabilities
- Container name injection through architecture detection manipulation
- **Mitigation**: Strict allowlist of valid architecture strings
- Path traversal through malicious architecture values in container mounting
- **Mitigation**: Validate architecture strings against regex pattern

## 7. Rollout & Deployment
### Feature Flags
No feature flag needed - architecture detection will be always-on with graceful fallback to current behavior if detection fails.

### Deployment Steps
1. Update `claude-reactor` script with architecture detection
2. Test on both ARM64 and x86_64 development machines
3. Update Makefile and test suite
4. Update documentation

### Rollback Plan
- Architecture detection failure falls back to current behavior (no architecture suffix)
- Users can force rebuild without architecture detection if needed
- Existing containers and configurations remain functional

## 8. Open Questions & Assumptions

### Open Questions
1. Should architecture preferences be stored in `.claude-reactor` config file or always auto-detected?
2. How should we handle architecture conflicts between local builds and registry images?
3. Should architecture selection be user-overrideable via command line flag (e.g., `--arch x86_64`)?
4. What's the optimal strategy for registry architecture manifest management and caching?
5. Should we implement Docker buildx multi-platform builds or maintain separate architecture builds?
6. How do we handle mixed-architecture development teams and shared project configurations?
7. What's the best approach for architecture-aware CI/CD pipeline integration?

### Assumptions
- Docker is configured to run native containers (not emulated)
- `uname -m` provides reliable architecture detection on target platforms  
- Users prefer automatic detection over manual configuration
- Current container variants work well on both architectures without modification
- Performance improvement will be significant enough to justify the complexity
