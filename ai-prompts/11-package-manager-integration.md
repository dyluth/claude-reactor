# Feature: Package Manager Integration

## 1. Description
Create unified package manager integration that automatically detects, installs, updates, and manages dependencies across all supported languages and frameworks within claude-reactor containers. This provides a consistent dependency management experience regardless of technology stack, with intelligent caching, security scanning, and cross-language dependency resolution for polyglot projects.

## Goal statement
To provide developers with a unified, intelligent package management experience that automatically handles dependencies across all supported languages while maintaining security, performance, and consistency within claude-reactor containers.

## Project Analysis & current state

### Technology & architecture
- **Current claude-reactor**: Go-based CLI with 5 container variants supporting multiple languages
- **Language Support**: Go modules, Rust Cargo, Node.js npm/yarn, Python pip/poetry, Java Maven/Gradle
- **Container Variants**: Each variant includes appropriate package managers pre-installed
- **Build Integration**: Existing build system integration with language-specific tooling
- **Mount System**: Host directory mounting enables persistent dependency caching
- **Docker SDK**: Container management enables dynamic package installation and updates
- **Key Files**: Dockerfile variants, `internal/docker/manager.go`, build system integration

### current state
**Current Package Management:**
1. Each language uses its native package manager independently
2. No unified interface or cross-language dependency management
3. Manual dependency installation and updates within containers
4. No centralized caching or optimization across projects
5. No automated security scanning or dependency analysis
6. No intelligent dependency conflict resolution

**Missing Integration Capabilities:**
- No unified package management interface across languages
- No cross-project dependency caching and optimization
- No automated dependency updates and security patch management
- No dependency vulnerability scanning and reporting
- No polyglot project dependency coordination

## context & problem definition

### problem statement
**Who**: Developers working with multi-language projects or teams using different technology stacks
**What**: Face fragmented dependency management, inconsistent tooling, security vulnerabilities, and inefficient dependency handling across different languages

**Current Pain Points:**
- **Fragmented Tools**: Different commands, workflows, and concepts across package managers
- **Security Gaps**: No unified vulnerability scanning across all project dependencies
- **Cache Inefficiency**: Redundant downloads across projects and language ecosystems
- **Update Management**: Manual tracking and updating of dependencies across languages
- **Polyglot Complexity**: Difficult coordination between languages with shared dependencies

## 6. Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- Respect existing package manager authentication (npm tokens, private registries, etc.)
- Secure storage of registry credentials and authentication tokens
- Support for private registries with authentication requirements

### Data Validation & Sanitization
- **Package Name Validation**: Prevent dependency confusion and typosquatting attacks
- **Version Validation**: Ensure version strings are properly formatted and safe
- **Registry Validation**: Validate registry URLs and prevent malicious redirect attacks
- **Cache Integrity**: Cryptographic verification of cached packages and metadata

### Potential Vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Confusion**: Malicious packages with similar names - mitigation: package name validation and registry verification
- **Supply Chain Attacks**: Compromised packages or registries - mitigation: signature verification and vulnerability scanning
- **Cache Poisoning**: Malicious packages in shared cache - mitigation: cryptographic integrity checking
- **Privilege Escalation**: Package installation with elevated privileges - mitigation: container security boundaries

## 7. Rollout & Deployment

### Feature Flags
Package manager integration will be opt-in initially, with gradual migration to default enabled.

### Deployment Steps
1. **Core Infrastructure**: Implement package manager abstraction and detection
2. **Caching System**: Add intelligent dependency caching and optimization
3. **CLI Integration**: Add unified package management commands
4. **Security Features**: Integrate vulnerability scanning and security reporting
5. **Beta Testing**: Test with development teams across different language ecosystems
6. **Public Release**: Announce unified package management with migration guides

### Rollback Plan
- **Opt-in Feature**: Disabled by default, no impact on existing package manager workflows
- **Native Fallback**: Automatic fallback to native package managers if unified system fails
- **Cache Cleanup**: Safe removal of dependency cache without affecting project dependencies
- **Full Backwards Compatibility**: All existing dependency management workflows remain functional

## 8. Open Questions & Assumptions

### Open Questions
1. Should unified package management be enabled by default or require explicit opt-in?
2. How do we handle package manager-specific features that don't translate across languages?
3. What level of polyglot dependency coordination is realistic and valuable?
4. Should we integrate with IDE package management features or remain CLI-focused?
5. How do we handle private registries and enterprise package management requirements?
6. What's the optimal balance between cache efficiency and storage usage?
7. Should we support custom package manager plugins for specialized tools?

### Assumptions
- Developers will value unified interface over native package manager optimization
- Cache performance improvements outweigh additional complexity
- Security scanning integration provides significant value for development teams
- Polyglot projects are common enough to justify cross-language coordination features
- Dependency caching across projects is safe and beneficial
- Performance optimization won't compromise package manager compatibility
