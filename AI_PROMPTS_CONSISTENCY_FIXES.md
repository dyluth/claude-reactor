# AI-Prompts Consistency Analysis and Fixes

## 🎯 **Master Document**: ROADMAP.md

The ROADMAP.md is the authoritative master document. All ai-prompts documents should align with its structure, numbering, and priorities.

## ❌ **Issues Found**

### **1. Numbering Misalignment**
- `2-multi-architecture-support.md` should be `3-multi-architecture-support.md` 
- Missing documents for actual Phase 1 priorities

### **2. Obsolete Content**
- `1-Claude_CLI_in_Docker.md` - Original basic setup, now obsolete
- `3-modular-restructure.md` - Go implementation already completed in Phase 0

### **3. Missing Current Priorities** 
- No ai-prompts documents for Phase 1 items (VS Code integration, templates, etc.)

## ✅ **Recommended Actions**

### **Immediate Fixes:**

1. **Archive Obsolete Documents**
   ```bash
   mv 1-Claude_CLI_in_Docker.md archive/01-original-docker-setup.md
   mv 3-modular-restructure.md archive/03-go-restructure-completed.md
   ```

2. **Rename Multi-Architecture Document**
   ```bash
   mv 2-multi-architecture-support.md 3-multi-architecture-support.md
   ```

3. **Update Multi-Architecture Content**
   - Remove "CRITICAL" ARM64 hardcoding issues (already fixed)
   - Update to reflect current Go implementation state
   - Align with ROADMAP.md Phase 2 priorities

### **Missing Documents to Create:**

Based on ROADMAP.md Phase 1 priorities, create:

1. **`1-vscode-devcontainer-integration.md`** 
   - VS Code Dev Container Integration (Phase 1, Item #1)
   - Highest priority for developer experience

2. **`2-project-templates-scaffolding.md`**
   - Project Templates & Scaffolding (Phase 1, Item #2) 
   - Eliminates setup friction

3. **`4-hot-reload-file-watching.md`**
   - Hot Reload & File Watching (Phase 1, Item #4)
   - Faster development cycles

4. **`11-package-manager-integration.md`**
   - Package Manager Integration (Phase 1, Item #11)
   - Unified dependency management

### **Content Updates Needed:**

1. **Update `3-multi-architecture-support.md`:**
   - Remove CRITICAL issues already resolved
   - Update current state section
   - Align implementation plan with Go CLI
   - Update success criteria

2. **Update all documents:**
   - Reference Phase numbers from ROADMAP.md
   - Ensure priority levels match (🔥, ⭐, 💡)
   - Update timelines and effort estimates

## 📝 **New Document Structure (Aligned with ROADMAP.md)**

### **Phase 1 Documents (Core Developer Experience):**
- `1-vscode-devcontainer-integration.md` 🔥
- `2-project-templates-scaffolding.md` 🔥  
- `4-hot-reload-file-watching.md` 🔥
- `11-package-manager-integration.md` 🔥

### **Phase 2 Documents (Enhanced Capabilities):**
- `3-multi-architecture-support.md` ⭐ (existing, needs updates)
- `5-environment-management.md` ⭐ (to be created)
- `8-resource-management.md` ⭐ (to be created)
- `9-backup-disaster-recovery.md` ⭐ (to be created)

### **Phase 3 Documents (Ecosystem & Enterprise):**
- `6-plugin-system.md` 💡 (to be created)
- `10-cicd-pipeline-templates.md` 💡 (to be created)
- `7-security-scanning-compliance.md` 💡 (to be created)
- `12-database-service-integration.md` 💡 (to be created)

### **Phase 4 Documents (Advanced Analytics):**
- `13-development-metrics.md` ⭐ (to be created)
- `14-health-monitoring.md` 💡 (to be created)

## 🎯 **Implementation Priority**

1. **IMMEDIATE** (Next 1-2 weeks):
   - Archive obsolete documents
   - Rename and update multi-architecture document
   - Create Phase 1 priority documents (VS Code, templates)

2. **NEAR-TERM** (Next month):
   - Create remaining Phase 1 documents
   - Begin Phase 2 document creation

3. **FUTURE** (As needed):
   - Create Phase 3 & 4 documents when those phases begin

## ✅ **Success Criteria**

- [ ] All ai-prompts documents align with ROADMAP.md numbering
- [ ] Document priorities match ROADMAP.md classifications (🔥, ⭐, 💡)
- [ ] Phase assignments are consistent across both locations
- [ ] No obsolete or outdated content in active documents
- [ ] Clear 1:1 mapping between ai-prompts and ROADMAP.md features

This will ensure the ai-prompts directory serves as detailed implementation guides that perfectly complement the high-level ROADMAP.md master document.
